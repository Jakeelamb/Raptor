ðŸ§¬ Methodology Outline for the Ultimate Rust-Based K-mer Assembler
Phase 0: CLI & Project Initialization

    Tooling: clap for argument parsing, log or tracing for diagnostics

    Crate Structure: Use a monorepo or workspace to separate core, cli, gpu, and distributed modules.

Phase 1: Efficient FASTQ â†’ FASTA Conversion (SeqKit-inspired)

    Stream-based I/O using BufReader/BufWriter

    Supports plain and gzipped input using flate2

    Implements parallel I/O pipeline with rayon or crossbeam::channel

    Uses thread-safe buffer pooling to avoid excess allocation

âœ… Output can be optionally compressed (FASTA or gzipped FASTA)
Phase 2: K-mer Normalization (BBNorm-inspired, CMS-based)

    Count k-mers using Count-Min Sketch (CMS) implemented with Vec<Vec<u16>>

    Normalize reads to a target coverage using probabilistic read retention

    Optional error correction using low-abundance k-mer detection

ðŸ”§ Reuse ahash or fasthash crates for efficient hash functions

âœ… Memory footprint remains constant and adjustable
Phase 3: Adaptive Multi-k K-mer Counting (Variable-k Strategy)

ðŸ”„ New Feature: Adaptive k-mer sizes

    Support a range of k-mer sizes (e.g., 21â€“31)

    Choose k adaptively per region based on:

        Coverage (higher k for high-coverage regions)

        Entropy / complexity (lower k for repeats or low complexity)

ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes:

    Maintain a map: HashMap<(k, kmer), u32>

    Use a heuristic to select the best k for each read (or window within a read)

    Predefine allowable k-mer sizes to avoid combinatorial explosion

âœ… Makes assembly more robust to repeats and low coverage areas
Phase 4: RLE Compression for K-mers and Sequences

ðŸ”„ New Feature: RLE (Run-Length Encoding)

    Apply RLE to sequence storage and optionally to k-mer representations

    Greatly reduces memory when handling poly-nucleotide repeats or ONT/PacBio data

ðŸ”§ RLE Format: Vec<(u8, u8)> for (base, count)

    Implement .to_rle() and .from_rle() helpers

    Derive Eq, Hash, Clone for use in maps/sets

âœ… Can be toggled via CLI flag for compatibility with downstream tools
Phase 5: GPU-Accelerated K-mer Counting

ðŸ”„ New Feature: GPU Acceleration

    Use OpenCL kernels via the ocl crate

    Offload the following tasks:

        Hashing and sketch insertion

        Histogram generation

    Integrate with CMS or standard HashMap strategy

ðŸ”§ Workflow:

    Read batches of sequences into pinned memory

    Transfer to GPU as bit-packed k-mers

    Launch kernels for counting

    Transfer CMS back to host and merge

âœ… Optional flag --gpu for enabling GPU mode
Phase 6: SIMD-Accelerated Sequence Matching

ðŸ”„ New Feature: SIMD Acceleration

    Apply SIMD for:

        Overlap detection

        Reverse complement calculation

        K-mer equivalence comparison

ðŸ”§ Implementation:

    Use [std::arch] intrinsics or wide for portable SIMD

    Use 128-bit or 256-bit vectors for AVX2-compatible machines

âœ… Applied in hot loops (e.g., contig extension, graph traversal)
Phase 7: Greedy K-mer Extension (Inchworm-like)

    Build greedy contigs from most-abundant k-mers

    Use adaptive-k selection for extension where available

    Track k-mers used to avoid reuse (bitset or HashSet)

âœ… Run parallel extension on disjoint seed pools
Phase 8: Graph Construction (Chrysalis-like)

    Create overlap graph of contigs

    Build connected components using petgraph or custom adjacency structure

ðŸ”„ New Feature: Distributed Graph Construction

    Partition reads by minimizer or syncmer buckets

    Assign each bucket to a separate thread or cluster node

    Each partition assembles its subgraph independently

ðŸ”§ Options:

    Local: Use rayon for threading across partitions

    Cluster: Use mpi-rs or nats.rs to send serialized buckets

    Consider outputting temporary files for SLURM compatibility

âœ… Huge assemblies now scalable across cores or nodes
Phase 9: Graph Traversal & Transcript Resolution (Butterfly-like)

    Simplify graphs (remove tips, bubble popping)

    Traverse paths with read-pair support and coverage scoring

    Output final sequences per path

âœ… One thread per graph component (embarrassingly parallel)
Phase 10: Graph Export in GFA Format

ðŸ”„ New Feature: Graph Output

    Output assembly graphs in GFA 1.0 or 2.0

    Compatible with Bandage, BandageNG, ODGI

ðŸ”§ Format:

    S lines for nodes (contigs)

    L lines for overlaps

    Optional P lines for paths

ðŸ”§ Crate: gfa or custom serialization

âœ… Debuggable assemblies, integrable with visualization tools
ðŸ§° Optional Add-ons and Utilities

    --report: Output stats (contig N50, max length, memory usage)

    --gfa-only: Skip contig export, just produce graph

    --dry-run: Useful for testing normalization or graph construction only

    --viz: Launch Bandage from CLI with current GFA
